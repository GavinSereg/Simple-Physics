- Physics.c is a program built using SDL2. You can find their site, and documentation at [https://www.libsdl.org/]

- This program was built to learn Cmake, SDL2, and implementing gravity/velocity with code.
- I used points on the screen to draw mutiple balls. The balls are dynamic, changing their x and y values based on collisions with walls. Ideally, I would like to continue this program furthur by detecting other collisions with other balls. I may also add a feature to not spawn a ball in the same region as another.

- In the defines section, there are three constants you may change.
   - The WIDTH or HEIGHT of the screen size (in pixels).
   - The number of balls rendered named NUMBEROFBALLS.
   - The title of the window TITLE.

- This is my first time using SDL2 and first time ever implementing any kind of movement in code. The program will be linked on my GitHub for others to view, or make recommedations/changes.
